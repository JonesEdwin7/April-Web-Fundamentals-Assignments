    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
        a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content
        into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other
        tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

    </p>


    <p>
        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
        researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
        system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
        Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the
        project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many
        areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
        in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        JavaScript.[2]

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
        separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file
        to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

    </p>
    <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
        for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
        reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
        accessed on a mobile device.[4]

        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than
        one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
        text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service
        for CSS documents.[5]

    <p>
        Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All
        font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often
        repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet,
        resulting in considerably simpler HTML.

    <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript [10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the
        World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page
        behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
        engine to execute the code on users' devices.

        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14]
        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
        interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
        Object Model (DOM).
    </p>
    <p>
        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a
        variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages
        are distinct and differ greatly in design.

    <h2>REACT JS</h2>
    <p>
        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3] for building
        user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of
        individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of single-page,
        mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with
        state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of
        additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.[7]
    </p>
    <p>
        Another notable feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model, or virtual DOM. React creates an
        in-memory data-structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM
        efficiently.[10] This process is called reconciliation. This allows the programmer to write code as if the
        entire page is rendered on each change, while the React libraries only render subcomponents that actually
        change. This selective rendering provides a major performance boost.[11] It saves the effort of recalculating
        the CSS style, layout for the page and rendering for the entire page.
